# Issue #1: Update Tests to Work with Real Data

## **Problem Statement**
The current test suite uses mock data that doesn't reflect the actual structure and content of real Phish.net data. This causes test failures and reduces confidence in our test coverage when working with production data.

## **Current Issues**
- Tests expect exactly 4 songs, but real data has 955+ songs
- Mock data structures don't match actual API responses
- Tests fail when run against real processed data
- Coverage reports are inaccurate due to mock dependencies

## **Proposed Solution**
Refactor the test suite to work with actual data while maintaining test reliability and performance.

## **Use Cases**

### UC1: Data-Driven Test Expectations
**As a developer**, I want tests that validate against real data ranges and patterns
**So that** I can catch issues that would occur in production

**Implementation:**
- Replace exact match expectations with range-based assertions
- Use statistical validations (e.g., "at least 500 songs")
- Test data structure integrity rather than exact values

### UC2: Snapshot Testing for Large Datasets
**As a developer**, I want to detect unexpected changes in data processing
**So that** I can quickly identify when data parsing logic breaks

**Implementation:**
- Create snapshot tests for sample data subsets
- Test data transformation pipelines
- Validate processed data structure consistency

### UC3: Performance Testing with Real Data Volume
**As a developer**, I want to test performance with realistic data sizes
**So that** I can identify bottlenecks before deployment

**Implementation:**
- Test API response times with full dataset
- Memory usage validation with large collections
- Pagination and filtering performance tests

## **Technical Implementation**

### Phase 1: Test Data Strategy
```typescript
// Before (Mock Data)
expect(result).toHaveLength(4);
expect(result[0].timesPlayed).toBe(1234);

// After (Real Data Expectations)
expect(result.length).toBeGreaterThan(800);
expect(result[0].timesPlayed).toBeGreaterThan(500);
expect(result.some(song => song.name === 'You Enjoy Myself')).toBe(true);
```

### Phase 2: Data Validation Helpers
```typescript
const validateSongStructure = (song: Song) => {
  expect(song).toHaveProperty('name');
  expect(song).toHaveProperty('timesPlayed');
  expect(song.timesPlayed).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  expect(song.longestJam?.length).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(song.averageLength);
};
```

### Phase 3: Integration Test Setup
```typescript
// Test against actual processed data
const realData = await import('../../public/processed-data.json');
const testSubset = realData.songs.slice(0, 10); // Use subset for performance
```

## **Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] All tests pass with real Phish.net data
- [ ] Test coverage remains above 80%
- [ ] Tests run in under 10 seconds
- [ ] Data structure validation is comprehensive
- [ ] Statistical assertions replace exact matches
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are established
- [ ] Documentation is updated with new test patterns

## **Implementation Tasks**

- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Analyze real data structure and patterns
- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Create data validation helper functions
- [ ] **Task 1.3**: Refactor getSongStats tests
- [ ] **Task 1.4**: Update filtering and search tests
- [ ] **Task 1.5**: Add performance test suite
- [ ] **Task 1.6**: Update test documentation
- [ ] **Task 1.7**: Configure CI/CD to run against real data

## **Dependencies**
- Stable processed-data.json file
- Jest configuration updates
- Performance testing utilities

## **Estimated Effort**
**8-12 hours** (Medium complexity)

## **Priority**
**High** - Required for reliable CI/CD pipeline

## **Labels**
`testing`, `data-validation`, `tech-debt`, `high-priority`

# Issue #2: Implement Additional Visualization Components

## **Problem Statement**
The current dashboard provides basic charts but lacks comprehensive visualization options for exploring Phish's rich performance data. Users need more interactive and insightful ways to analyze song patterns, tour dynamics, and historical trends.

## **Current Limitations**
- Only basic bar charts and tour circles available
- No time-series analysis for historical trends  
- Limited interactivity in existing visualizations
- No venue or geography-based visualizations
- Missing song relationship and set analysis tools

## **Proposed Solution**
Develop a comprehensive suite of interactive visualization components that provide deeper insights into Phish's performance history and patterns.

## **Use Cases**

### UC1: Historical Timeline Visualization
**As a Phish fan**, I want to see how song frequency and jam lengths evolved over time
**So that** I can understand how the band's musical style has changed across eras

**Implementation:**
- Interactive timeline with era markers (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0)
- Line charts showing song frequency trends
- Heat maps of jam lengths by year
- Filterable by song, venue type, or tour

### UC2: Geographic Performance Mapping
**As a user**, I want to explore Phish performances by location
**So that** I can see regional patterns and plan travels to historic venues

**Implementation:**
- Interactive world/US map with performance markers
- Venue clustering with show counts
- State-level statistics and rankings
- Heat map overlays for song debuts or jam lengths

### UC3: Set List Analysis Dashboard
**As a data analyst**, I want to analyze set structures and song relationships
**So that** I can discover patterns in Phish's musical arrangements

**Implementation:**
- Set flow diagrams showing common song transitions
- Network graphs of frequently paired songs
- Set length and energy flow visualizations
- Encore pattern analysis

### UC4: Song Evolution Tracking
**As a musician**, I want to track how specific songs have evolved
**So that** I can study performance variations and musical development

**Implementation:**
- Song-specific timeline with notable performances
- Jam length progression charts
- Version comparison tools
- Audio waveform integration (if available)

### UC5: Interactive Dashboard Builder
**As a power user**, I want to create custom dashboard layouts
**So that** I can focus on the metrics most important to me

**Implementation:**
- Drag-and-drop dashboard interface
- Customizable widget library
- Saved dashboard configurations
- Export capabilities for charts and data

## **Technical Implementation**

### Phase 1: Enhanced Chart Library
```typescript
// New visualization components
export const TimeSeriesChart = ({ data, metric, timeRange }) => {
  // Interactive time-series with zoom/pan
};

export const GeographicMap = ({ shows, venues, metric }) => {
  // Leaflet/Mapbox integration with clustering
};

export const NetworkGraph = ({ songs, connections, layout }) => {
  // D3.js force-directed graph for song relationships
};
```

### Phase 2: Interactive Features
```typescript
// Cross-filtering and brushing
export const useCrossFilter = (datasets) => {
  // Implement crossfilter.js for linked interactions
};

// Real-time updates
export const useDataStream = (endpoint) => {
  // WebSocket or polling for live data updates
};
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics
```typescript
// Statistical analysis components
export const TrendAnalysis = ({ data, algorithm }) => {
  // Regression, moving averages, seasonal decomposition
};

export const AnomalyDetection = ({ performances, threshold }) => {
  // Identify unusual performances or patterns
};
```

## **Component Library Expansion**

### New Visualization Types
- **Sunburst Chart**: Hierarchical tour/venue/song relationships
- **Sankey Diagram**: Song flow through sets and shows
- **Radar Chart**: Multi-dimensional song characteristics
- **Violin Plot**: Distribution of jam lengths with quartiles
- **Heat Calendar**: Performance frequency by date
- **Chord Diagram**: Song co-occurrence matrix
- **Treemap**: Hierarchical venue or song data
- **Parallel Coordinates**: Multi-dimensional filtering

### Interactive Features
- **Zoom & Pan**: All time-based charts
- **Brushing & Linking**: Connected chart interactions
- **Tooltips**: Rich hover information with audio samples
- **Filtering**: Real-time data filtering across all charts
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions for data updates
- **Export**: PNG, SVG, PDF export capabilities

## **Data Enhancement Requirements**

### New Data Processing
```typescript
// Geographic data enrichment
interface VenueLocation {
  venue: string;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  city: string;
  state: string;
  country: string;
  capacity?: number;
  venueType: 'indoor' | 'outdoor' | 'festival' | 'arena';
}

// Song relationship analysis
interface SongTransition {
  fromSong: string;
  toSong: string;
  frequency: number;
  setPosition: 'opener' | 'closer' | 'encore' | 'middle';
  averageGap: number;
}

// Performance metrics
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  energy: number;        // Calculated from length, position, audience
  rarity: number;        // Based on gap and frequency
  significance: number;  // Notable performances rating
  jamRating?: number;    // Community or algorithmic rating
}
```

## **UI/UX Enhancements**

### Dashboard Layout System
- **Grid-based Layout**: Responsive grid system for widgets
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Expand any chart to full view
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interactions
- **Dark/Light Themes**: User preference support
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation support

### Performance Optimizations
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Handle large datasets efficiently
- **Progressive Loading**: Load data as needed for large visualizations
- **WebGL Rendering**: Hardware acceleration for complex graphics
- **Data Sampling**: Intelligent sampling for overview charts
- **Memoization**: Cache expensive calculations

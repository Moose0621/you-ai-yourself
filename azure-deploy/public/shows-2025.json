At the beginning of Disease, Trey told Mike to &ldquo;write it down brotha,&rdquo; which became a running gag throughout the first half of the song.

In response to a fan requesting more Syd Barrett after the last HYHU, Fish spoke the first few words of Bike. Trey teased Call to the Post before YEM (as Fish was returning to his drum kit after HYHU). Before Contact, Fish said &ldquo;We would like to perform for you now the bass-player-is-taking-a-leak-song.&rdquo; Fish then dedicated Contact to Paul Languedoc. Also before Contact, Page told the crowd that their bass player (whom Trey then referred to as &ldquo;Michael Cactin&rdquo;) would become 25 years old at midnight.

In the sketch, the band was forced to hang out with Jarret&nbsp;and his friends after being involved in a car accident with one of them. Gore appeared in the sketch as one of the students&rsquo; professors. All four members of Phish joined in to play a snippet of Contact in the dorm room. Later, Robert Smigel&rsquo;s <em>TV Funhouse</em> cartoon parodied the ability of Charlie Brown and his <em>Peanuts</em> friends to transform and enliven anything (e.g., a dumpy Christmas tree) by just &ldquo;waving their arms around a lot.&rdquo; Phish appeared as the &ldquo;transformed&rdquo; version of Schroeder and his friends, who had been playing music themselves.

The pre-show music alluded to the end of the hiatus with such songs as the theme from <em>Welcome Back Kotter</em>, Feels Like the First Time, Back in the Saddle Again, Reunited, and The Boys are Back in Town. The final selection was Foreplay/Long Time, during which time the band took the stage. Prior to Wilson, a scene from the Tom Hanks movie <em>Cast Away </em>was played in the arena (referring to Hanks\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character searching for his volleyball/companion named Wilson). Trey subsequently introduced Hanks to sing the final lyric. Major news media reported the Hanks appearance, but the guest singer was actually Page\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother, Steve McConnell. Mound was played for the first time since November 19, 1996 (276 shows). Bowie included a DEG tease. This show included the debuts of Waves, Seven Below and Walls of the Cave. Appropriately, Seven Below began about seven minutes before midnight. During the song, the crew lowered a disco ball from the scoreboard and created a \u00e2\u0080\u009csnowfall\u00e2\u0080\u009d on stage. Dancers dressed in white as snow creatures took the stage and circled the band before dispersing into the crowd. Some of the dancers ascended ladders and donned stilts to become snow angels. At midnight, white balloons and confetti were dropped on the crowd. A little person remained on each front corner of the stage, popping balloons, while the snow angels continued to dance. Runaway Jim contained a Weekapaug tease\u00c2\u00a0from Page. Time Loves\u00c2\u00a0a Hero was last\u00c2\u00a0played\u00c2\u00a0August 11, 1998\u00c2\u00a0(or 153 shows).

The Phish debut of Moby Dick featured Fish&nbsp;soloing on both drums and vacuum. The subsequent Bowie intro&#39;s continuation contained a Simpsons signal and Happy Trails and&nbsp;Jingle Jangle Jingle teases. Bowie later contained Moby Dick teases. Happy Birthday was teased in Bowie and Ya Mar and performed by Page during Love You. Mockingbird and Big Ball Jam contained &quot;Charge!&quot; teases. Lawn Boy&nbsp;was dedicated to Page&rsquo;s parents. Funky Bitch through Llama&nbsp;featured Jimmy Herring sitting in on guitar. My Sweet One was unfinished. After the first HYHU, Trey tried unsuccessfully to convince Colonel Bruce Hampton to come out and jam on horns. Love You featured Fish&nbsp;on guitar and vacuum, as well as the delivery of a birthday cake. Trey also presented Fish&nbsp;with a clock necklace a la Flavor Flav of Public Enemy, so that Fish would never again be late for the bus. Amazing Grace was performed without microphones and was also dedicated to Page&rsquo;s parents with Page saying it was one of his father&#39;s favorite songs. Page&#39;s father gave a standing ovation after the song&#39;s finish. AC/DC Bag was played for &ldquo;Hack&rsquo;s&rdquo; 21st birthday, as he had evidently requested it at a party the night before.

As homage to the movie <em>Old School </em>(which also featured Dust in the Wind), Trey encouraged the crowd to &ldquo;earmuff&rdquo; it while Dan received his prize.

    "setlist_notes": "Trey, Mike, Fish, and Jeff Holdsworth performed what is believed to be their first public gig together as Phish on this night. The band was short on equipment, so a hockey stick was used as a microphone stand. Between sets, the DJ spun some Michael Jackson and Trey drummed along to the album. The house music (which included more Michael Jackson) was presumably turned up after Fire on the Mountain to drown out the band. The setlist may be incomplete, though, as the master recording contains nothing after Trey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sarcastic comments about Michael Jackson following Fire on the Mountain. All songs were, of course, Phish debuts. Back in Black was teased before Scarlet Begonias. While this show is often billed as an ROTC Halloween Dance that took place on October 30, 1983, this is incorrect. The master copy of the recording of this show, as unearthed by Phish archivist Kevin Shapiro, contains a handwritten note that pegs the date as December 2, 1983. In discussions with Kevin, band members confirmed that they recall rehearsing for this show over the Thanksgiving Break, and that the show was a Christmas semi-formal. Also, it was not an ROTC-sponsored event; it was a dorm dance in a predominantly ROTC dorm (Mike\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dorm at the time). It was long believed that the band's name for this show was \"Blackwood Convention\" but Trey advised in a 2019 radio interview that \"we were never fucking called 'Blackwood Convention.'\"",

The music stand held a three-ring binder that contained lyrics from the Phish canon, but it did not play an active role in the performance. Ya Mar contained teases of The Tra La La Song (One Banana, Two Banana). At the end of Disease, a video screen descended behind the stage. As the house lights remained down, a 25+ minute video was played featuring retrospective highlights from throughout Phish&rsquo;s career. Before the second set, Mike brought out a tray of desserts and shared them with fans in front of the stage. Highway to Hell was briefly teased by Trey before Rock and Roll. Weekapaug was unfinished. Tweezer Reprise included lyrics (sung by Trey) from Mike&rsquo;s Song. Appropriately, the post-show house music was the Beatles&rsquo; song Sgt. Pepper&rsquo;s Lonely Heart&rsquo;s Club Band (which begins with the lyric, &ldquo;It was twenty years ago today&hellip;&rdquo;).",

NICU contained Shafty teases from Mike. Weigh was played for the first time since August 2, 1998 (202 shows). Gin included Show Biz Kids teases. 2001 included a P. Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up) jam containing some brief lyrics, as well as Gin,\u00c2\u00a0Auld Lang Syne, and The Little Drummer Boy teases. Tube was unfinished. L.A. Woman was a Phish debut; Birds included L.A. Woman teases. During Makisupa, Trey noted that they were going to play Touch Me, but decided not to because Fish couldn't remember the words and they didn't know how have a horn section. To make it up to the crowd for letting them down, Trey brought out George Clinton and Parliament/Funkadelic (also known as The P. Funk All-Stars). Trey commented\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cand that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even<em> better</em> than Touch Me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Page teased Touch Me while Trey was talking. The ensuing P.

Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up), and One Nation Under A Groove. Get Low (Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz) was also part of the medley. By the end of the jam, Fish\u00c2\u00a0was alone on stage playing vacuum. Fish then exited, leaving the stage empty. Phish returned alone to finish Makisupa; to prove that P. Funk was better than Fish\u00c2\u00a0singing Touch Me, Makisupa closed with Fish\u00c2\u00a0singing the first line of Touch Me <em>a cappella.</em> During the last chorus of Contact, Trey sang lines like \u00e2\u0080\u009cL.A.

Weekapaug included Jungle Boogie lyrics and a Divided Sky tease; Weekapaug, YEM, First Tube, and Chalk Dust also included Auld Lang Syne teases. Seven Below was unfinished. The house music played over the P.A. during the second setbreak consisted solely of songs that referenced &ldquo;cars&rdquo; in their titles. As midnight neared during Jungle Boogie (a Phish debut), Fish&rsquo;s drum kit was wheeled to the side of the stage. An Austin Cooper Mini automobile was lowered to the stage from above. The Miami Palmetto Senior High Band and cheerleading squad emerged from the car one-by-one, giving the impression that they were all in the car together. In reality, the car had touched down over a trap door in the stage and the guests came out from underneath. Also emerging were dancers similar to the bunny-women present at the IT Festival. The marching band joined in on the jam that emerged from Jungle Boogie. With the stage covered with marching band members and dancers (some even on top of Page&rsquo;s baby grand piano), an emcee (dressed in an Eddie George, Tennessee Titans, #27 football jersey) counted the clock down to midnight. A massive balloon drop followed. Phish then led the marching band through an instrumental version of Iron Man (also a Phish debut). Reba did not have the whistling ending. For his &ldquo;first song of 2004,&rdquo; in honor of the Miami Heat, Fish&nbsp;performed the Phish debut of Feel the Heat, which contained Fame quotes from Trey and Fish.&nbsp;HYHU contained more references to &ldquo;Henrietta&rsquo;s Heat&rdquo; as Fish&nbsp;took laps around the stage. Frankenstein was preceded by a Fluffhead tease.",

This show marked Chris Kuroda&rsquo;s first absence from the light crew since April 2, 1989 (1,179&nbsp;shows). Disease was unfinished. Jennifer Hartswick assisted on vocals during Girls, a Jay-Z cover that made its Phish debut. Secret Smile featured a new arrangement.&nbsp; This was the first Sneakin&#39; Sally to contain a vocal jam since May 28, 1989 (1,150&nbsp;shows). The vocal jam led into a brief quote of Coconut.&nbsp; Trey then asked Fish&nbsp;if he was wearing his &ldquo;new suit,&rdquo; referring to his&nbsp;sonic dress. After Fish&nbsp;answered &ldquo;no,&rdquo; Trey went on to rap about how people would have to attend the following night to see Fish&nbsp;play it. The rap slid into a bit of free-form vocal jamming to close the show.",

It&#39;s true. He&#39;s dead.&quot; Stash was played by request for &quot;Big Phil&quot; Muller, and was preceded by Fish&nbsp;playing the <em>Charlie Chan</em> signal. Fish&nbsp;said &quot;he wrote it,&quot; Trey said &quot;probably because I wrote it,&quot; and Mike added &quot;I think it sucks. Essentially.&quot; Regarding Stash, Trey said &quot;I collaborated on this song writing the music end of it and the lyrics were written by another native New Jerseyian, Tom Marshall, who isn&#39;t here tonight, unfortunately, because he&#39;s gotta be at work tomorrow programming computers.&quot; Fish&nbsp;added &quot;for his dad&quot; and Trey responded &quot;My dad, he works for my dad. Keeping it all in the family here.&quot; Stash and La Grange contained Buried Alive teases. Prior to Landlady, Trey said they were going to play it in honor of their first gig in New Jersey. Mike introduced Destiny Unbound as a song he wrote about his Uncle Pendleton Vandiver. Prior to Buried Alive, Trey asked for a show of hands from the sparse crowd as to how many people in the room were actually from New Jersey and said &quot;we&#39;re going to play a song that we wrote that we think captures the spirit of New Jersey,&quot; calling it &quot;New Jersey And You, Perfect Together,&quot; which is the state&#39;s tourism slogan (a joke he later referenced in Golgi and Contact). Trey encouraged the crowd to &quot;sing along when the chorus comes, just like it&#39;s a big commercial, because we&#39;ll be filming this for the next New Jersey commercial.&quot; During I Didn&#39;t Know, Trey introduced Fish&nbsp;as &quot;Zero Man&quot; and the song&#39;s lyrics were changed to Pardon Me &quot;Zero Man.&quot; Before Contact, Trey introduced his dog Marley as &quot;the 5th member of the band who doesn&#39;t usually get as much recognition... and we&#39;re going to play Marley&#39;s favorite song -- at this moment in time.&quot;",

This show featured the Phish debut of I Kissed a Girl (described by Trey as &ldquo;so wrong on so many levels&rdquo;).&nbsp; After Harpua, Trey remarked to Fish that he was waiting for the day when Fish went to see Katy Perry and she performed a Phish song, prompting Fish to declare, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t apologize to Katy Perry for that. I only apologize to [the audience].&rdquo; Prior to the encore, Trey stated that it was hard to play the last show of the tour because they felt like they could just keep going.&nbsp; Before starting the debut performance of I Been Around, Trey explained that they were playing it because he realized that it was the one song off of the upcoming album (<em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Joy</em>) that they hadn&rsquo;t played live.",

Trey then referenced &ldquo;the greatest songwriter of all time&rdquo; and said that he, too, grew up in the area. While some in the crowd expected Bruce Springsteen (who was in the middle of a run of 15 sold-out dates at New Jersey&rsquo;s Continental Airlines Arena), Trey produced Tom Marshall. Tom appeared in the classic <em>Born in the U.S.A</em>.-era Springsteen outfit, complete with red bandana. He subsequently sang the Phish debut of Born to Run. As the song concluded, Tom mocked a bunch of Springsteen-esque arena-rock clich&eacute;s, such as throwing his bandana into the crowd and jogging offstage to a handler who threw a towel around his shoulders. During the song he even aped some dance moves from the Dancing in the Dark video.",

Trey explained the record that the band was trying to break while Sofi Dillof danced on stage and the <em>Guinness</em> staff videotaped the crowd. Part of the Piper intro was used on the studio Piper released on <em>Farmhouse</em>. Some musical chaos ensued between Catapult and Icculus (first since October 31, 1995, or 262 shows), where Trey rambled about the negative aspects of television and the positive aspects of books and Mike teased Meatstick. The ensuing Smoke on the Water Jam included Cat Scratch Fever teases. Subsequently, Icculus was followed by more narration and a tease of Miss You. The show closed with fireworks during Hood.",

This show contained the first known version of You Enjoy Myself, although it is possible that the correct debut was on 2/1/85, and the\u00c2\u00a0first known performances of Zenzil\u00c3\u00a9's pieces (all with Phish) Tonight, The Pendulum, Babylon is Burning, and Dec 1661.

Sound was engineered by Garrett Mead.

Melt contained A Love Supreme teases.\u00c2\u00a0After the ensuing Catapult, Trey remarked: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly at the largest concert in the world could we get away with playing a song like that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After Midnight made its Phish debut. The late set, also known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Show,\u00e2\u0080\u009d began at around 11:35. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFather Time\u00e2\u0080\u009d was on stage, pedaling on an exercise bike that powered a large clock. The sounds of the clock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gears could be heard through the sound system. About ten minutes before midnight, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFather Time\u00e2\u0080\u009d collapsed from exhaustion and the clock stopped. Then, a large fan boat entered the concert field and approached the stage. Early in its journey, the fan boat exploded away and revealed the hot dog used in the 1994 New Year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stunt. While the band rode the hot dog to the stage, an instrumental version of Meatstick began to play over the P.A.. The band reached the stage and fed several meatsticks to Father Time, reviving him so that the clock could continue moving toward midnight. The band then took the stage and played Meatstick to begin The Show. Dancers were on stage prior to Phish reaching it. Auld Lang Syne and Disease were accompanied by fireworks.\u00c2\u00a0Heavy Things was recorded live and rebroadcast as part of ABC television\u00e2\u0080\u0099s New Year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Eve coverage. In a humorous effort to confuse the home audience, Trey instructed the crowd to yell the word \u00e2\u0080\u009ccheesecake\u00e2\u0080\u009d in lieu of cheering at the end of the song. After twice giving the example of yelling the word once, Trey changed his mind and instructed the crowd to chant it, adding for them to say it like they were pissed. Trey then introduced the band for the rebroadcast and offered a message of peace and harmony for the world where he reminded people to drive in the right lane unless passing another vehicle. Meatstick was subsequently teased as the New Year approached in the central time zone. YEM included a vocal jam based around the word \u00e2\u0080\u009ccheesecake\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Trey altered the lyrics to Axilla and Albuquerque to reference the word. Inlaw Josie Wales featured Trey on acoustic guitar. Sand contained My Soul teasing from Mike and segued into the debut of Quadrophonic Toppling. Rock and Roll included an After Midnight tease. Love You included band introductions; Fish\u00c2\u00a0introduced Page before the song and Mike and Trey afterwards, and the band as \u00e2\u0080\u009cPhish 2000\u00e2\u0080\u009d (see November 2, 1990). Piper contained Bug teases from Page. 2001 began with the signature Hood drum roll. After the show closed with yet another version of Meatstick, the Beatles song Here Comes the Sun was piped through the crowd at sunrise. Two bustouts were played: Crosseyed and Painless (first since August 13, 1997, or 159 shows), and Love You (first since July 5, 1997, or 179 shows).",

In typical Phish fashion, to make the most of this opportunity, flyers were handed out to fans walking into the show that stated that the band had come up with a bunch of new 'language' signals designed to confuse the average radio listener. The signals would be written on signs and held up by Trey at various times throughout the night. The\u00c2\u00a0handout explained each signal. Wilson included a Simpsons signal, I Didn't Know contained a Yay/Boo signal, Antelope included a Random Note signal, the Mockingbird narration included a Mass Hysteria signal, and Harpua included a Lip-Flop signal. Wilson and the end of Divided Sky contained <em>Jeopardy!</em> teases from Page and Antelope contained an Auld Lang Syne tease from Trey. Brad Sands was hoisted above the crowd as The Famous Mockingbird (in a chicken\u00c2\u00a0costume) during the Mockingbird narration (about being taken underwater and turned into stone). The narration also contained\u00c2\u00a0teases of \"Charge!\" and the theme to <em>Star Trek</em> from Page. This was the first time that Mike\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Weekapaug were played without Hydrogen in the middle as the band treated the audience to a fantastic New Year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transition. The Mike\u00e2\u0080\u0099s combo included Trey counting down to the New Year and telling the crowd that they better make the last minute of the year a good one. Kung was played for the first time since November 2, 1989 (417\u00c2\u00a0shows). This show featured the Phish debut (and only appearance) of Diamond Girl, which featured The Dude of Life on vocals.

Sometimes it&#39;s great, but sometimes... you wonder.&quot; Mike, more charitably, stated, &ldquo;On a scale of two to three, I give it a three.&rdquo; Before the Drums Jam with Trey and Fish, Trey noted that it had always been a dream of his to start a song with a double drum solo; this was the first known instance.",

    "setlist_notes": "This was the second show of the Coventry festival and was the presumed \u00e2\u0080\u009cFinal Show.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0When Trey made his \u00e2\u0080\u009cbreak-up\u00e2\u0080\u009d announcement the preceding May, he indicated that Coventry would be the final Phish shows. In reality, this turned out to be the final public show for over four and a half years. This show was simulcast in movie theaters nationwide. Before Anything But Me, Trey announced that, for the first time in 21 years, he was nervous performing a Phish show. During Wolfman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Trey revealed that the Wolfman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Brother is, in fact, Fish (as well as the fact that he handed the phone to his friend Liz Durfee). Also, during Wolfman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Trey and Mike invited their mothers onstage (and later John Paluska) to do the \u00e2\u0080\u009csexy bump\u00e2\u0080\u009d dance. Disease was unfinished and featured Trey briefly playing his guitar with a glow stick. Both Page and Trey broke down during an especially emotional Velvet Sea. After a thoroughly botched Glide, all four band members offered words of thanks to the fans for their continued support and dedication and brief reflections on their twenty years together. Trey then stated that what they really needed to do was \u00e2\u0080\u009cblow off some fucking steam\u00e2\u0080\u009d before starting up Melt. There was an enormous glow stick war during Ghost featuring hundreds, if not thousands, of orange glow sticks. This version of Seven Below saw all of the band members sporadically shouting \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeven Below\u00e2\u0080\u009d throughout the jam. The Phish debut of Cool Jerk contained alternate lyrics honoring monitor mixer, Mark \u00e2\u0080\u009cBruno\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bradley. The Dickie Scotland Song was spontaneously created and included lyrics in honor of production manager, Hadden Hipsley, and tour accountant, Richard Glasgow (a.k.a. Dickie Scotland). Before Wilson, Trey asked the crowd to sing to another of their friends \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor the last time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There was a fireworks display between the end of the third set and the encore. Before the encore, while explaining the origins of The Curtain, Trey jokingly announced that the entire Chicago Symphony and the Twyla Tharp Dance Troupe were going to perform Gamehendge. Trey explained that they chose The Curtain With as the last song to bring them full circle, because, not only was it one of the first Phish songs he wrote, but he wrote it in a cabin one town over from Coventry. Trey stopped and restarted the jam segment of the Curtain With, because they were in the wrong key or, as he explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009dSince we are going to be bringing ourselves back in time, we may as well do it in the correct key.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There was no P.A. music after the Curtain With.",

During Tweezer Reprise, the Art Tower was burned to the ground as The Great Went came to a close. As the Hood jam kicked in, Trey asked Chris to turn the lights off and the band jammed while the front section of the audience engaged in the first Hood glowstick war. Trey remarked to the crowd at the end of the jam that the visual display was cool. Between the first and second sets, the Bangor Symphony Orchestra performed selections from Stravinsky and Debussy as a red-smoke-spewing glider synchronized its swoops and dives to the music.

San Francisco radio station KFOG leaked word of an upcoming \u00e2\u0080\u009csurprise announcement\u00e2\u0080\u009d two weeks before the show, telling Phish fans to tune in on Saturday morning for details. The 11:00 a.m. announcement was that tickets would be sold at noon the vacant Pier 32, prompting a mad rush of fans to the waterfront. Of the several thousand who arrived, roughly four hundred lucky people were able to buy vouchers entitling them to a pair of tickets. Prior to Brian and Robert, Trey said that Fish used to hate the yellow light and that Fish used to have a list of things that he hated, adding that every time they found out something Fish hated, they'd always do it (prompting Page to tease HYHU, which Fish also hates). Fish added that he hated the vowel \"ooo\" (the crowd responded with \"ooo\" noises). Trey said the only way to overcome something you hate was to face it head on. Trey then had Chris Kuroda shine a yellow light on Fish for Brian and Robert.\u00c2\u00a0Reba did not have the whistling ending. Hood contained a tease of Aaron Copland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fanfare for the Common Man.

John Paluska and Ben Hunter, who were managing Phish at the time, therefore rented the room for the evening. John and Ben promoted the gig heavily, including via radio. Tickets were only $5. Tom Baggott, a fan of the band, helped get Burlington fans to the show by Greyhound bus. Not only did the gig sell out, but there were some 200 people shut out (mostly Boston University and Boston College students). I Didn&#39;t Know featured Fish&nbsp;on trombone. Alumni contained additional lyrics. Prior to YEM, Trey welcomed his mom, who had come &quot;all the way from Ireland.&quot; After YEM, Trey said that they had a special guest that night for the person in the front row that kept requesting that they play Minkin. Trey mentioned that there was a Minkin hanging behind the band and that Minkin was also there that night. There was a subsequent brief Minkin vocal tease prior to Lizards. This version of Sanity was the fast version.",

When the band retook the stage, they started up a humorous pass at You Shook Me All Night Long and then dove back into Fluff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Travels. Fire was dedicated to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrave men\u00e2\u0080\u009d who turned off the fire alarm. Suzy contained Sailor's Hornpipe\u00c2\u00a0teases from Trey. Trey and Page teased Blue Monk in Possum. Bowie included a brief Frosty the Snowman jam in the intro, as well as a Riders on the Storm tease from Page and a Santa Claus is Coming to Town tease. Melt contained a Fish\u00c2\u00a0drum solo. Love You was played for the first time since October 31, 1987 (138\u00c2\u00a0shows) and featured Fish\u00c2\u00a0on trombone. Harpua contained \"Charge!\" and Price of Love teases from Page, multiple Gimme Some Lovin' teases, and a Walk This Way tease from Mike.",

Between Divided Sky and Lizards, Trey again referenced &ldquo;Burlington, Ontario,&rdquo; noting that it is out near Gamehendge, and asked if there were any &ldquo;Gamehendgians&rdquo; out in the audience. Fish&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t able to get any suction out of the vacuum during Bike; he subsequently used the trombone during I Didn&rsquo;t Know. The first known Phish performance of Immigrant Song was sung <em>a cappella</em>.",

These opening sets are sometimes referred to as \u00e2\u0080\u009cJazz Odyssey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the lone known taper labeled his master tapes as such. All Blues was played for the first time since April 25, 1986 (119\u00c2\u00a0shows). During Antelope, Trey told the story of what happened to Fish\u00c2\u00a0that evening and explained that Fish, who had been at the top of a mountain and, therefore, late for the gig, had to \u00e2\u0080\u009cRun like an Antelope, out of control.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Elsewhere in the set, Trey chided Fish\u00c2\u00a0for his tardiness. The narration in Harpua was straightforward, with no teases. Anarchy was jokingly named Whipping Post. Terrapin featured a Fish\u00c2\u00a0trombone solo.

Adding to the confusion was an explosion on or near the stage during David Bowie (possibly a flash pot or fireworks) which pushed the crowd over the edge. The show was cut short when the house lights were turned on and bouncers quickly evacuated everybody from the venue. The source of these show notes is phish.com.",

Trey also picked up a Hacky Sack from the stage and impressed the crowd with his athleticism.

Brother was dedicated to &ldquo;the guy who offered us $10,000 to play a different song.&rdquo; In the HYHU intro, Fish&nbsp;said &ldquo;I hate this fucking song,&rdquo; that the only reason the band plays the song is because he hates it and added &ldquo;All I have do in this band is say I hate something, and it&rsquo;ll be done forever.&rdquo; Trey told the crowd that HYHU is the Henrietta theme precisely because Fish hates it. &ldquo;It used to be &lsquo;La Bamba,&rsquo;&rdquo; he noted, prompting Mike to play a bit of La Bamba. The HYHU outro featured Fish on trombone and later telling the crowd &quot;you paid for this, this is what you bought.&quot; Trey said &quot;If you only knew what a nightmare that was for poor Fish, having to listen to that song&quot; and Fish responded with &ldquo;they just do it out of HATE.&rdquo; Trey asked who could tell him who wrote that song, and a fan answered correctly. Trey said the fan won the $10,000 the other guy was going to give them to a play a song and Page said the fan won a date with Fish, with Trey adding &quot;and you can guarantee that he&#39;ll be late.&quot; After Golgi, Trey thanked the crowd, saying &quot;we&#39;ll be right back with more songs that Fish hates, more songs that we love, and more songs that people are willing to pay $10,000 to hear.&quot; Trey introduced Page as Leon before his piano solos in My Sweet One and Rocky Top. Before Fish&#39;s trombone solo in I Didn&#39;t Know, Trey mentioned the last time they played in the area (see 4/11/91), they made Fish get up and tell a joke (The Prison Joke) that was &quot;absolutely the stupidest joke ever&quot; and that he (Trey) wasn&#39;t going tell the punchline. Trey went on to explain that most people around here thought Fish was a pretty bad joke teller and he wanted to give him a chance to redeem himself.&nbsp; Fish&#39;s joke was &quot;Why did the Siamese twins go to England? To let the other one drive for a while.&quot; Page also teased HYHU while Trey talked. Adeline was sung from the balcony without microphones to open the encore. Possum contained two <em>Charlie Chan</em> signals as well as Simpsons and Random Laugh signals in its intro and subsequently contained Rock On (David Essex) teases.",

    "setlist_notes": "Harpua included a story from Mike about a dream about raccoons. The Michael Jackson references continued, as Trey teased the audience by saying that Jimmy was listening to the Halloween album while the band played a Beat It tease. Also, the second set was preceded by recorded Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' and Thriller teases from Michael Jackson's <em>Thriller </em>album. The second set \"musical costume\" was The Who's <em>Quadrophenia</em> and was performed with Dave Grippo on alto saxophone, Don Glasgo on trombone, Joey Sommerville on trumpet and Alan Parshley on French horn. During Bell Boy, crew member Leigh Fordham, clad in a bell boy outfit, sang Keith Moon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original part. All of the <em>Quadrophenia</em> songs, as well as My Generation, were Phish debuts. YEM was almost 40 minutes long, contained teases from Trey of The Real Me and DEG, a Spooky tease from Page, and was preceded by the audience chess move. The chosen fan, dressed as a Wookiee, cracked under the pressure and could not choose a move on stage, prompting a quote from Fish that \u00e2\u0080\u009cWookiees can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play chess.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Rock was teased after the failed move. Jesus Just Left Chicago featured Grippo on alto saxophone; Suzy Greenberg featured Grippo, Glasgo and Somerville. My Generation was performed acoustic. Before My Generation, the crew set up a Keith Moon replica drum set on stage. After the song, Fish\u00c2\u00a0and Trey destroyed the drum set a la The Who. Finally, a stagehand brought out a large plunger. Trey pressed it and set off a huge explosion backstage. This show was officially released as <em>Live Phish 14</em>. In the soundcheck, Suzy Greenberg was performed three times: the first with only Grippo, the second with the band and Grippo, and the third with all of the horns, alternate lyrics, and Bell Boy quotes. The jam through the end of the soundcheck was played with horns.",

Suzy included a Simple tease. The phrase &ldquo;21 year old Phish Fan Marcus Esquandolas&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;Marco Esquandolas&rdquo; during Antelope in reference to a fan&rsquo;s quote in a newspaper article on the disturbance in Morrison the day before. Tweezer included a Norwegian Wood jam. Harry Hood featured the debut of the &ldquo;Hood&rdquo; response chant, initiated by Phish.netters and advertised on flyers handed out at the Red Rocks shows. Among other ideas, the flyers encouraged fans to shout: &ldquo;Hood&rdquo; after the band sings &ldquo;Harry.&rdquo; It began to rain in the second set; the band responded with Purple Rain, and Chris Kuroda showed the stage in purple lights. The performance of Simple from this gig appears on the <em>Carved in Stone</em> CD benefiting The Rocks Fund, dedicated to the rehabilitation and preservation of Red Rocks Amphitheatre.",

Perazzo also played during the entire third set. Jesus Just Left Chicago, Suzy Greenberg, and Frankenstein also featured Grippo and Gazaway. At the end of Houses in Motion (which featured Trey teasing Tweezer), an armchair was brought out to the center of the stage and Mike sat in it to sing Seen and Not Seen. While he sang, Karl Perazzo drummed and Trey played bass. After Overload (which featured Fish singing in front of the band and not on drums), a bizarre on-stage demonstration (including Fish on vacuum) closed the set. The third set opened with a Feel Like a Stranger tease. Suzy included Once in a Lifetime teases from Mike and a Born Under Punches tease from Page.

The band pointed at Fish, who looked confused as huge props of a hot dog, fries and shakes descended from the ceiling next to the drum set. The band played 2001 while the hot dog landed. The James Bond Theme was then broadcast over the PA while technicians (wearing \u00e2\u0080\u009cRocket Scientist\u00e2\u0080\u009d jackets) prepared the hot dog, and the band climbed in with their instruments and flew out over the audience, as balloons popped and feathers, confetti and \u00e2\u0080\u009cPhish NYE 1994\u00e2\u0080\u009d ping pong balls fell from the ceiling.

The first set featured Trey and Mike on acoustics, Page solely on piano, and a unique stage setup&nbsp;that had Fish&nbsp;stage right with Page on the far left. Before Brian and Robert, Trey encouraged the crowd to sit down due to the &quot;mellow&quot; nature of the set; he added that they had never before played to a crowd that was sitting. Whether the crowd should stand up or sit down became a running joke throughout the set, until Trey confessed during Wilson that he only asked the crowd to sit down at the request of the crew and, in fact, he hates telling people what to do (and also hates sitting down). This show marked the Phish debuts of Invisible and Sleep Again. Fish&nbsp;performed a whistle solo on My Sweet One. The band briefly left the stage after McGrupp, returning to encore with Driver, Talk, and Secret Smile. The second and third sets were played later that evening.&nbsp;Reba lacked the whistling ending. Trey took a moment before Tweeprise to thank those who helped put on the festival.",

Prior to the third set, a pedestal stating 2010 was placed on the front of the stage and a covered structure was placed behind Fish's drumset. During DWD, as the clock turned midnight, hundreds of balloons were released upon the crowd, fireworks went off on each side of the stage, and a disco ball was lowered onto the pedestal. After DWD, Trey opened the ball and Fish\u00c2\u00a0climbed inside. Trey and Mike, with some help from stagehands, proceeded to put the ball in a giant cannon aimed towards a giant net hanging from the rafters with an illuminated \u00e2\u0080\u009cX\u00e2\u0080\u009d on it. Page hit the trigger and purportedly \"blasted\" the ball through, not only the net, but also the roof of the arena. A searchlight appeared to come through the roof and was accompanied by helicopter sounds. With Fish\u00c2\u00a0apparently shot out of the venue, Trey asked if anybody knew how to play the drums and ended up finding Sarah, a girl from Pittsburgh. Trey asked how long she had played the drums and what her favorite song was and she responded with six months and Fluffhead respectively. Sarah was surreptitiously replaced by Fish, now wearing a dress identical to Sarah's and a black wig, who played the entire third set and encore, but Sarah came out at the end of the third set and bowed with the band instead of him. Blue Moon was a Phish debut and was performed as an instrumental while Trey thanked the entire crew. After the show, the disco ball was revealed to have \"crashed\" into a white car that had been parked in front of the American Airlines Arena with a sign on the windshield stating \"This car was driven down from Vermont\" and \"fueled by maple syrup.\" \u00c2\u00a0After being \u00e2\u0080\u009cstruck\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the \u00e2\u0080\u009chuman cannonball,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the car was emitting smoke and leaking maple syrup and the entire area was cordoned off with police tape.\u00c2\u00a0",

The second set \"musical costume\" was Little Feat's\u00c2\u00a0<em>Waiting for Columbus</em>. Join the Band (the first track of\u00c2\u00a0<em>Waiting for Columbus</em>)<em>\u00c2\u00a0</em>was played over the P.A. before the start of the second set. Subsequently, Phish was introduced by Kevin Statesir (founder of Higher Ground) as \"Little Feat\" before Fat Man in the Bathtub. In the tradition of some of Phish's previous crowd experiments in the early '90s, flyers explaining a new Secret Language prank were included in the Phishbills that were passed out to fans as they walked into the show. The prank, designed to confuse those who would later listen to the recording, consisted of an announcer introducing Phish (as Little Feat). When the announcer would say a letter of the band FEAT (\"Give me an F!\"), the crowd would respond with letters corresponding to PHISH (\"P-H!\"). All of the songs in the second set other than Time Loves a Hero were Phish debuts. All of the songs in the second set, other than Don't Bogart That Joint and Willin', featured Giovanni Hidalgo on percussion. A five piece horn section consisting of Aaron Johnson on trombone, Stuart Bogie on saxophone, Ian Hendrickson-Smith on saxophone, Michael Leonhart on trumpet, and Eric Biondo on trumpet joined the band for Old Folks Boogie, Time Loves a Hero, Day or Night, Mercenary Territory, Spanish Moon, Dixie Chicken, Rocket in My Pocket and Feats Don't Fail Me Now. Willin' featured Page on bass, Mike on piano, Trey on drums and Fish on vocals. Prior to the piano solo at the beginning of Willin', Fish remarked, \"That's supposed to be Bill Payne on the keyboard.\" Don't Bogart That Joint was performed <em>a cappella</em>. Trey introduced the guest musicians at the start of Feats Don't Fail Me Now and Page teased \"Charge!\" during the introductions. At the conclusion of the second set, the entire band marched the perimeter of the floor. Disease was unfinished, was initially botched, and had to be restarted, prompting Fish to declare, \"This one's off <em>our </em>album.\" Julius featured Giovanni Hidalgo and the <em>Waiting for Columbus</em>\u00c2\u00a0horn section.",

Shortly after the song began, steam also came from the floor near the soundboard area. An amp (with the steam kettle on it), a keytar, a bass, a vacuum, and a few lights were then lifted off the stage. A woman in the front of the stage tossed a &ldquo;Steam&rdquo; sign into the front row, then rose with a barricade and security guard before eventually being lifted up over the band. Several other aerialists (clothed in various casual attire, equipped with black backpacks emitting smoke and lights on their backs) subsequently rose up from the crowd and ascended and descended several times. The first aerialist counted down to midnight, at which point balloons were released from the ceiling. The aerialists later returned with lights in their hands for Down with Disease, which also featured Trey and Mike being raised up and back down a few times before finally rising several feet on hydraulic lifts. Steam contained a Spooky tease from Trey and Disease was unfinished.",

Antelope included alternate lyrics \"Been you to tuck in your dress, man?\" \"Tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck\" and\u00c2\u00a0\"Tuck in your dress man, you're out of control!\" Trey also said that for 30 years, Fish has been leaving his dress untucked and told everybody to tuck in their dresses. Mike, Trey, and Page tucked in their shirts before the setbreak bow. Split Open and Melt included the alternate lyrics \"Split open and tuck.\" Backwards Down the Number Line contained a DEG tease from Trey.

And that one too. But the force is strong with that one.\" \u00c2\u00a0The audience was subsequently called out by Fish, Trey, and Page, in part being told repeatedly \"You suck at tucking\" over the Maze intro. The Maze intro also featured Trey asking Chris Kuroda to turn off the lights while he waved the light saber around, talked like Darth Vader, saying \"I am your father, Fish. I am your father,\" and played the guitar with his light saber. Fire contained more Tuck references, with Trey saying \"Tuck it!\" and the alternate lyrics \"Let the Tucker take over!\"\u00c2\u00a0Mike and Trey sported sombreros for Mexican Cousin.",

Fish&nbsp;then arrived on a golf cart wearing donut pants and shirt, an argyle vest, and a golf hat. &nbsp;Golf carts were brought back on stage during Kung, then began racing past the stage periodically during Chalk Dust. During the Chalk Dust jam, golfers began getting out of the carts, hitting balls into the crowd and dancing on stage. &nbsp;One of the golfers did the New Year&#39;s countdown from on top of a cart. &nbsp;Auld Lang Syne was accompanied by balloons dropping from the ceiling and ping pong balls fired from cannons. &nbsp;Tweezer Reprise featured Carrie Manolakos on vocals and a number of backup singers. The remainder of the third set and encore featured song titles focusing on a golf theme. Wilson was preceded by an animated Wilson golf ball on the venue&#39;s jumbotrons. Iron Man was preceded by Page coming to the front of the stage to wish the crowd Happy New Year and reference the start of the 30th year of Phish. In an apparent reference to Bob Hope, Page wore a blazer, USS Nimitz ball cap and carried a golf club. Driver was stopped and restarted.This show featured the Phish debuts of Garden Party and Fly Like an Eagle, the first full Phish performance of Iron Man (which was last played December 31, 2003, or 192 shows), and the first ever <em>a cappella</em> Lawn Boy.",

Melt contained a DEG tease from Trey. During Grind, the &quot;days lived&quot; stated by the band referenced how old they would be when they returned for their 60th anniversary. During the encore break, a video montage&nbsp;of photographs and film from throughout Phish&#39;s history and previous New Year&#39;s Eve concerts was shown.&nbsp;After the encore,&nbsp;a video image was shown of a &quot;Save the Date&quot; card for Phish&#39;s 60th anniversary show (on December 31, 2043) with each band member digitally aged.",

Fish suggested they play In A Hole, but Trey said he could not remember it. He agreed to sing the chorus, however, and sang part of it briefly (emphasizing&nbsp;the pun on the &quot;a hole&quot; lyric)&nbsp;while Fish and Page played a small&nbsp;part of the music of the song&#39;s chorus. &quot;It&#39;s just as funny as it was 30 years ago,&quot; Page noted. &quot;Thank you for laughing.&quot; Fluffhead contained a Dave&#39;s Energy Guide tease.",

The musical costume was a set of original, mostly instrumental music played with the sound effects and narration of the 1964 Disneyland album <em>Chilling, Thrilling Sounds of the Haunted House</em>. Prior to the start of Set II, the stage was cleared of all band equipment, and a graveyard set was brought out. At the start of the set, smoke filled the stage, and zombies appeared behind the gate. When the gate opened, a large haunted house with the band inside was brought to the front of the stage. The sound effects and narration were played on the PA, while an undead narrator would emerge from a crypt inscribed with &quot;ESTHER&quot;&nbsp;prior to each song for&nbsp;the introduction. At the end of The Fuse, the sides of the house came down while sounds of an explosion were heard, and the band was revealed inside, dressed in white tuxedoes and with zombie face paint. Several zombies came to the front of the stage and danced during Martian Monster. At the conclusion of the set, the band members came down from the Haunted House riser, slowly walked to the front of the stage, and took bows, along with the entire cast of zombies. All songs during the second set were debuts, with the titles taken from the first ten tracks of <em>Chilling, Thrilling Sounds of the Haunted House</em>. Sand contained a tease by Trey&nbsp;of School&#39;s Out.&nbsp;Is This What You Wanted&nbsp;was a Phish debut.

For that set, the band performed in elaborate costumes (helmets and all), with alternate instruments (Trey on a BCR Mockingbird), each playing within a flashing/glowing shape (two circles and two squares), after descending (in the form of holograms) from the ceiling in cylinders of colored light. Knuckle Bone Broth Avenue included extended choreography by Trey and Mike. During Get More Down, matching upright geometric shapes danced around behind the band, reducing to the two circles overlapped by Egg in a Hole, which featured pyrotechnics. Before Clear Your Mind, Trey introduced the band as from the year 4680 (the total of the October 28, 2021 songs as noted during that night's encore-ending Grind). During The 9th Cube, there were projections of donuts and turtles on a cube above the band. Fireworks rained down on the stage during The Inner Reaches of Outer. For I Am in Miami, Trey switched to an acoustic guitar and the band stood together at stage front with the four-mic a cappella setup. After the set, the band departed as holograms back up the colored tubes. Soul Planet contained Knuckle Bone Broth Avenue and Don't Doubt Me quotes. Mike quoted Thanksgiving in Death Don't Hurt Very Long. The start of Harry Hood included alternate lyrics (Holy Blankenstein).",

    "setlist_notes": "<p>Page teased The Little Drummer Boy in the first Tweezer. Trey teased Super Bad in Weekapaug. The second setbreak music was comprised of songs referencing past Phish New Year&#39;s Eve gags. Before the third set began, a barbershop quartet appeared with a singing telegram for Phish. The telegram said that at the stroke of midnight it would be 40 years for Phish and to make a wish. Trey wished he had a time machine so they could do it all again. A cube descended from overhead and a time machine was revealed near Mike. The quartet activated the time machine and the cube played audio and video from past years of Phish. Dancers from various past new year&#39;s gags appeared on stage as well as a wombat (from October 31, 2013). The wombat broke the time machine and Ghost began with dancers and characters (like Father Time from December 31, 1999 and the Famous Mockingbird from December 31, 1992) continuing to appear from the band&#39;s past performances. Ghost featured Meatstick lyrics sung from the band as well as by dancers in different languages in a nod to December 31, 2010. The first Bohemian Rhapsody since December 31, 1996 (852 shows) featured the <em>Late Show</em> Gospel Choir singing on risers behind the band and Ghost quotes from Page and the choir with subsequent lyrics changed to reference Ghost. The first Jungle Boogie since December 31, 2003 (544 shows) featured the BD Entertainment Marching Band marching band along with the choir. The marching band and choir were also featured in Wilson where a platform above Trey that had appeared for the entire New Year&#39;s run descended and the clone that had been lying on the platform rose and was revealed to be a Tom Hanks actor from <em>Cast Away</em>. Inflated Wilson volleyballs were then tossed into the crowd. Only the final verse was sung in Wilson which contained Jungle Boogie quotes and was unfinished. During Auld Lang Syne, Phish briefly stopped playing and ate cake in front of the stage while the marching band and choir continued to perform. Carini featured several dancers in &quot;naked dude&quot; costumes emerging from a birthday cake in front of the stage and dancing and running around with security trying to catch them. The Theme from <em>New York, New York</em> was performed for the first time since December 31, 1997 (774 shows) and featured the naked dude dancers performing a kickline in front of the stage while adding vocals and Trey changing the lyrics to &quot;if I could be naked there.&quot; Page teased Tweezer in Caspian. Piper contained Crosseyed quotes. During Tweezer Reprise, the wombat ran and danced across the stage. The post show music was Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, which was a nod to Phish playing their 72nd show at Madison Square Garden, tying Elton John.</p>\r\n",

    "setlist_notes": "<p>Tube contained teases of the theme from <em>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</em>. Harpua was unfinished and contained a Vibration of Life tease. During the Harpua narration, Trey talked about some of the Harpuas and Phish shows at Madison Square Garden of the past 40 years, and a bed appeared from beneath the front of the stage with an actor playing Jimmy and a puppet version of Poster Nutbag. Trey then interrupted the song before the &quot;I want a dog&quot; lyric and said Jimmy had lacked a strong female influence over the years and introduced actress Annie Golden as Jimmy&#39;s grandmother. While consoling Jimmy, she told him it was time to tell the truth about the owner of Harpua. After telling Jimmy that the old man had given the puppet to Esther and helped Jimmy&#39;s cousin Reba make liquid meat, a vinyl record (with a rhombus on the cover) was brought forth and Jimmy&#39;s grandmother said &quot;it&#39;s time... it&#39;s New Year&#39;s Eve and I can&#39;t let you ring another new year without knowing the real story of Gamehendge!&quot; leading into The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday and a glowing rhombus rising to frame the entire stage. The band then began the first performance of the Gamehendge saga since July 8, 1994 (1,194 shows), with Golden and Trey providing the narration and performers acting out the parts of Colonel Forbin, Rutherford, the AC/DC Bag, Tela, Errand Wolfe (later billed in post show credits as &quot;The Wolf&quot;), and the Sloth. The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday, The Lizards, Tela, Wilson, Divided Sky, Colonel Forbin&#39;s Ascent, Fly Famous Mockingbird, and Split Open and Melt featured an off-stage backing chorus. The multi-beast and McGrupp were also performed by puppets. Tela performed acrobatics on wires during her song, with Jo Lampert (as the Wolf) providing additional vocals during Wilson. The Sloth&#39;s lyrics were changed to &quot;I&#39;m squeezing that Charmin. Thank you Mr. Whipple. I&#39;m still squeezing that Charmin. Thank you Mr. Whipple.&quot; Colonel Forbin ascended the rhombus during Colonel Forbin&#39;s Ascent (which had lyrics changed to &quot;weary body&quot;), and a large Famous Mockingbird puppet (with a top hat) flew over the crowd during Fly Famous Mockingbird, which also featured Annie Golden on additional vocals. Before Melt, Trey asked Jimmy&#39;s grandmother if she knew that the mountain was a volcano, and the Lizards reappeared to dance to the ensuing Melt jam, eventually leaving the stage one by one as the rhombus was lowered again.</p>\r\n",

During Back on the Train, psychedelic images of passing countryside were displayed behind and above the band, rotating in opposite directions in different sections of the dome. Trey teased Mercy, Mercy, Mercy in Wolfman&#39;s Brother. During Maze, psychedelic live images of each band member appeared, stacked on top of each other. These images then fragmented and spread out, dancing and turning throughout the jam. During Leaves, several giant paper lanterns appeared, flanking the stage, while the dome showed a multitude of paper lanterns floating over water, with the moon shining above. During Life Saving Gun, the dome displayed stacks of old-style televisions with rabbit ears, with each television showing a live shot of one of the band members. These TVs moved and rotated as the jam progressed. After the song, Trey said that he &quot;loves any song with a Jon Fishman percussion rinse,&quot; and told the crowd they should see the Sphere from the stage. During Dirt, the dome showed a forest view, looking upwards through trees at a purple-hued sky. During Tweezer, a field of multi-colored cars appeared behind the band, changing in size and shape and with their headlights blinking on and off in patterns, while other cars drove past overhead. My Friend, My Friend included live spotlight silhouettes of the band members projected across the entire dome and Egg in a Hole quotes from Mike and did not contain the &quot;Myfe&quot; ending. The projections during Mike&#39;s Song made it seem as if the venue was outdoors, with the band playing in front of a body of water with a rotating sculpture on the far shore. During Lifeboy, the sun went down and a number of other rotating sculptures lit up in the sky, creating a golden star-scape. The sun then rose again during Weekapaug. Blaze On&#39;s lyrics were changed to &quot;dancing in the Sphere.&quot; Farmhouse began and ended with Trey on acoustic guitar, as well as images of a farmhouse in a field under a night sky filled with stars and aurorae. This show was connected to the other three with each night&#39;s setlist tied into a state of matter. This performance&#39;s matter type was solid.</p>\r\n",

During Moma, a moving, 360-degree live shot of the crowd and band was displayed, with psychedelic colors and effects. During Mercy, the dome displayed an overhead view of a sparkling ocean, with small birds in pastel colors flying over the water. During Gin, the entire dome became an overhead view of a large wave pool, filled with hundreds of people on food-shaped inflatables drifting and spinning. During the Gin jam, the images of the bathers became blurred and abstract, forming a neon kaleidoscope effect. During Theme, the entire dome became an underwater seascape, with kelp forest, fish, human swimmers, and light from the surface shining down from the top. Theme also contained a DEG tease from Trey. At the start of ASIHTOS, jellyfish puppets were raised on each side of the stage, while the dome remained dark. Once the jam began, the light on the dome came up to reveal another underwater seascape, whose plants and fish became luminous as the rest of the light dimmed again. During Caspian, this seascape changed to a view from within the columns and arches of a sunken monument. As YEM began, the entire dome became the view from inside of a car as it entered a &quot;Tunnel of Luv&quot; car wash, with the stage appearing to sit on top of the middle of the dashboard. The car progressed through the wash as YEM continued, with Trey&#39;s solo during the wax and wheel scrub, and the bass and drums as the car was dried and exited the wash. Suddenly the car view was gone, and it appeared that the dome was clear, with a puppy licking it from the outside, in slow-motion, for the duration of the vocal jam. During Velvet Sea, the dome appeared to be covered in flowing red velvet, with photographs of the band throughout the years appearing and disappearing among the fabric. By the end of the song, the entire dome was covered in photos. Trey teased The Secret of Life (The Dead Milkmen) in Hood. This show was connected to the other three with each night&#39;s setlist tied into a state of matter. This performance&#39;s matter type was liquid.</p>\r\n",

During Pillow Jets, the view became that of a grassy path through a grove of trees under a starlit sky. Travelling down the path as the jam progressed, the grass and trees became tinged with glowing, multi-colored light, which periodically intensified and erupted from the ground through the branches, creating a firework effect. Mike and Trey teased Manteca during Steam. During Mountains in the Mist, the dome made it appear as if the venue was nestled in an evergreen-covered mountain range, with mist shrouding the sky from view. During Taste, the entire dome appeared to become covered in turning rings of Jim Pollock illustrations from the covers of the Live Phish CD releases, rendered in gold and black. During Sigma Oasis, the dome became a cloudscape, with trees, birds and sea creatures made out of bubbling clouds. During Fuego, a spotlight was used to create a silhouette of the band, with the image then recreated across the dome with effects added to make the band appear as flaming shadow people. During Twist, the dome became filled with multicolored letters tumbling before a backdrop of pulsing red circles. I Am Hydrogen was performed in a show without Mike&#39;s Song and Weekapaug Groove for the first time since October 31, 1987 (2,024 shows). A Life Beyond The Dream featured Trey on acoustic guitar.

During Ghost, the neon-colored outlines of three giant robots appeared to tower over the band, with their facial expressions varying and their arms and bodies swaying slowly. The three robots were then replaced by one massive robot, with spotlights utilized to make it appear as if beams of light were coming from the robot&#39;s eyes, before the original three robots returned for the remainder of the jam. During Divided Sky, the dome became a view of a sea of clouds, with patches of blue sky above. As the clouds moved, their appearance varied from purple sunset hues to dark and stormy, with the movement stopping and all of the color fading during the pause before returning for the rest of the song. Page teased Linus and Lucy at the end of Divided Sky. Trey began Shade on acoustic guitar. During Shade, an eclipsed star was shown behind the band, with its corona of changing colors visible and a silhouette of the band in the center. During Sea of Stars, the dome became filled with a curtain of gold-colored four-point stars, which twinkled and waved in front of roiling clouds. During 2001, the dome became a starfield before being illuminated by replicated images of the stage lights. Mike teased Plasma during Light. During Ether Edge, a string of umbrellas with colored drops trailing beneath were raised to either side of the stage. The umbrellas were lowered again during Piper. During First Tube, the dome again became a starfield, this time with a ring of stars centered above the stage slowly swirling. As the second &quot;verse&quot; of First Tube began, a white vortex appeared in this area. As the stars in its orbit began to become multicolored, the vortex pulled in their light and created flowing, rainbow-hued ribbons that grew as the jam progressed. Prior to More, Trey thanked the production team behind the Sphere shows, and said that he thinks the band will return to the venue. After Slave, the band gathered at the front of the stage to take bows and have a picture taken in front of the crowd. This show was connected to the other three with each night&#39;s setlist tied into a state of matter. This performance&#39;s matter type was plasma.</p>\r\n",

The dancers sang during Pillow Jets and What&#39;s Going Through Your Mind, which contained Blaze On, Bouncing Around The Room, Martian Monster, Wolfman&#39;s Brother, The Lizards, and Halley&#39;s Comet quotes. Life Saving Gun briefly featured Mike on a mini-keyboard. The narration in Icculus centered on Trey explaining that the omission of the song the previous year was a test.
